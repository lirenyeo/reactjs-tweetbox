# reactjs-tweetbox
Use this exercise to understand states, events and DOM rendering in ReactJS (ES6).

## Get Started
Cross origin requests are not supported by local files, so you can't just open `tweetbox.html` in browser. Use [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) to host a server.

Simply open the app, select the folder containg `tweetbox.html` and `tweetbox.jsx`, start the server and visit the localhost link.

## Objectives
Refer to this [demo](http://reactjs-study-group.s3-website-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/) for our final objective.
1. When user types something, the character count will reduce accordingly.
2. When user toggle on `Add Photo`, 23 word count will be deducted, and vice versa.
3. `Tweet` button is disabled whenever there is no text input or no `Add Photo`.
4. Upon exceeding 140 character counts, an alert overlay will appear, with overflowing text being highlighted.
